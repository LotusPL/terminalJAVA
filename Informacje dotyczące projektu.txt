Hi!

I would like to share my thoughts about this project.I'm going to use NIO library which is JDK Class. Sorry for not commiting my progress for few days, but I was very busy and didn't have time to work on this project. I will try to complete everything today and commit my progress.


I'm going to complete task using substring. I had problem when I was using path generated via Path class. I'm going to split string using '\' as separator.
